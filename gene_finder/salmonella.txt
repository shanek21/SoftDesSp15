In the dna sequence that we were given from salmonella I found 5 interesting amino acid sequences. All 5 sequences of amino acids turned out to code for proteins that are found in salmonella, which is a good thing considering that the DNA came from salmonella. Finding 5 salmonella proteins not only validates that my code is most likely working, but also tells me a bit about what kind of proteins make up salmonella. It seems that most of the proteins that I found are secretion proteins and surface proteins, which could be pointing to the idea that salmonella requires many of these types of proteins in order to function. The proteins that I found are listed below by the description and ID provided by BLAST.

Sequence 1-
Description: type III secretion system protein SpaO [Salmonella enterica]
Sequence ID: ref|WP_000058734.1

Sequence 2-
Description: type III secretion system protein SpaS [Salmonella enterica]
Sequence ID: ref|WP_000097719.1

Sequence 3-
Description: surface presentation of antigens, partial [Salmonella enterica]
Sequence ID: ref|WP_032488261.1

Sequence 4-
Description: antigen presentation protein SpaN [Salmonella enterica]
Sequence ID: ref|WP_000503098.1

Sequence 5-
Description: type III secretion system protein [Salmonella enterica]
Sequence ID: ref|WP_000526016.1
